  # When using Kingdoms as an international plugin, updating GUI files will get troublesome

  # When you decide to change the GUI layout for any GUI, you'd have to go to the
  # GUI config of all languages to update the layout as well. To make this simpler,
  # enabling this will allow you to synchronize non-translatable options across all
  # GUIs in other languages when they're changed.
  # You can also write "-NOSYNC" at the beginning of a comment of a YAML option to
  # exclude that option from being synchronized. This is used for advanced translatable
  # properties (such as commands or yaml functions)

# The file's name should be the same as the option below without the .yml file extension.
