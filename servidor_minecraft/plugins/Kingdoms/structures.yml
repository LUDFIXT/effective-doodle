# This config is mainly used for general structure settings.
# Note that some structures such as powercells, regulators and nexus are limited to 1
# structure per land by default as having more of them doesn't make sense.
# Set the limit option to 0 or -1 or just delete it entirely to disable the limit.
# NOTE: If you remove or add a structures style, you'll need to restart the server.
