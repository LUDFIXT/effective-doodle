# cost: Resource points required each time you upgrade.
# scaling: This depends on what the powerup does.
# max-level: If you decrease the max-level, kingdoms that already
#            upgraded that specific upgrade beyond the new value will keep their level,
#            and it won't affect them. Unfortunately, you can't fix this unless you
